# Oxygen Keyboard Shortcuts #

Adds keyboard shortcuts to add elements, save work, and other things in [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/)'s editor. You will find the shortcuts described below. This should also work for Mac users; replace Ctrl with the Apple icon.

I decided to use Ctrl + Alt because Ctrl alone would have some conflicts. This plugin has only been tested within Google Chrome.

## Installation ##

1. Click on the `Download ZIP` button at the right to download the plugin.
2. Go to Plugins > Add New in your WordPress admin. Click on `Upload Plugin` and browse for the zip file.
3. Activate the plugin.
